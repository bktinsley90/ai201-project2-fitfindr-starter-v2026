     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Finds listings matching a description, with optional size and inclusive maximum-price filters.
- **Inputs:** `description` (str), `size` (str | None), `max_price` (float | None).
- **Returns:** A list of listing dicts, best match first, each with `id`, `title`, `description`, `category`, `style_tags` (list), `size`, `condition`, `price` (float), `colors` (list), `brand` (str | None), and `platform`.
- **When it has nothing:** An empty list (`[]`).

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Suggests one or two outfits using a listing and the user's wardrobe.
- **Inputs:** `new_item` (dict with listing fields described above), `wardrobe` (dict with an `items` key containing a list of wardrobe items).
- **Returns:** A non-empty string containing one or two outfit suggestions; with an empty wardrobe, it gives general styling advice for the listing.
- **When it has nothing:** It still returns general styling advice when `wardrobe["items"]` is empty; it does not return an empty value.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Writes a short social caption about the listing and a suggested outfit.
- **Inputs:** `outfit` (str), `new_item` (dict with listing fields described above).
- **Returns:** A 2-4 sentence caption that mentions the item, its price, and its platform once each, with a specific vibe.
- **When it has nothing:** If `outfit` is empty or whitespace-only, returns a descriptive message instead of raising an error.

---

## Planning Loop

**Branch rule:** If `search_listings` returns an empty list, put a message in the session and stop. Otherwise, take the first result and go to `suggest_outfit`.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** The planned parser uses regular expressions to pull an optional size and an inclusive maximum price (for example, `size M` and `under $30`) from the user's text. The remaining words become the search description. This parsing still needs to be implemented in `agent.py::run_agent`.

**What moves through the session:** `new_session()` first stores the original `query` and `wardrobe`. The parsed `description`, `size`, and `max_price` go into `parsed`, then the search output goes into `search_results`. If there are matches, the first one is saved as `selected_item`; that item and `wardrobe` are used to produce `outfit_suggestion`, and the suggestion plus item produce `fit_card`. If there are no matches, `error` gets a message and the loop stops before setting the later result fields. The session fields are defined, but this flow still needs to be implemented in `run_agent`.

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

Happy path — the session printed at the end of `run_agent`:

```
$ python -c "import json, agent; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe; print(json.dumps(agent.run_agent('vintage graphic tee under $30, size L', get_example_wardrobe()), indent=2))"
{
  "query": "vintage graphic tee under $30, size L",
  "parsed": {
    "description": "vintage graphic tee",
    "size": "L",
    "max_price": 30.0
  },
  "selected_item": {
    "id": "lst_006",
    "title": "Graphic Tee — 2003 Tour Bootleg Style",
    "description": "Vintage-style bootleg tee with faded graphic. Slightly boxy fit. 100% cotton, soft and worn-in.",
    "category": "tops",
    "style_tags": [
      "graphic tee",

      "grunge",
      "streetwear",

  "outfit_suggestion": "Here are two wearable outfits featuring your new Graphic Tee, built entirely from items in your wardrobe:\n\n### Outfit 1: Streetwear Edge\n* **Top:** Graphic Tee — 2003 Tour Bootleg Style\n* **Bottoms:** Baggy straight-leg jeans, dark wash\n* **Outerwear:** Vintage black denim jacket\n* **Shoes:** Chunky white sneakers\n* **Accessories:** Black crossbody bag\n\n**Why it works:** \nThe boxy fit of the graphic tee pairs naturally with the relaxed, high-waisted silhouette of the baggy dark wash jeans for an effortless 90s streetwear look. Layering the slightly cropped vintage black denim jacket on top adds texture and dimension while keeping the color palette grounded in black and indigo. Finishing with chunky white sneakers ties the streetwear vibe together and adds a sharp contrast to the dark tones.\n\n### Outfit 2: Grungy Contrast\n* **Top:** Graphic Tee — 2003 Tour Bootleg Style\n* **Bottoms:** Wide-leg khaki trousers\n* **Outerwear:** Black cropped zip hoodie (worn open or layered)\n* **Shoes:** Black combat boots\n* **Accessories:** Brown leather belt, Black crossbody bag\n\n**Why it works:**\nThis look plays on a high-low mix of grunge and minimal styles. Tucking the graphic tee into the wide-leg khaki trousers (accented with the brown leather belt) creates a balanced silhouette that contrasts the tee's vintage edge with clean earth tones. Adding the black combat boots leans into the grunge aesthetic of the shirt, while the black crossbody bag keeps the accessories minimal and functional.",

  ],
  "wardrobe": "10 items"
}

selected_item id: lst_006
item received by suggest_outfit id: lst_006  → same listing

Empty path — a query nothing matches:

```
$ python -c "import agent; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe; s = agent.run_agent('designer ballgown size XXS under $5', get_example_wardrobe()); print(s['parsed'], s['search_results'], s['fit_card'], s['error'], sep='\n')"
{'description': 'designer ballgown', 'size': 'XXS', 'max_price': 5.0}
[]
None
No listings matched "designer ballgown". You could try fewer or different keywords, raise your $5 price limit, drop or change size XXS.

suggest_outfit called: no
```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"
[{'id': 'lst_002', 'title': 'Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print', 'description': 'Super cute early 2000s baby tee with butterfly graphic. Fitted crop length.

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe, load_listings; print(suggest_outfit(load_listings()[0], get_example_wardrobe()))"
**How it works:**
This look leans into the vintage streetwear vibe of the 501s by pairing them with classic basics. Tucking the white ribbed tank top in and defining the waist with the brown leather belt balances the straight-leg fit of the jeans. Layering the slightly cropped vintage black denim jacket on top creates a cool, all-denim look with nice contrast between the medium indigo wash and the black jacket. Finally, the chunky white sneakers and minimal black crossbody bag tie the casual, everyday outfit together comfortably.

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; from utils.data_loader import load_listings; print(create_fit_card('white sneakers', load_listings()[0]))"
Nothing beats the lived-in look of these Vintage Levi's 501 Jeans — Medium Wash paired with fresh white sneakers for an effortless streetwear fit. The knee fading gives them that authentic, broken-in character right out of the box. Snag this classic indigo pair for just $38.0 on depop before they're gone!

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
